### Lessons Learned in the Assignment:
1. In lesson 8 we learned about API's and how an API is an open set of standards and instructions for accessing a web-based application or tool. Such as Amazon's API being used to make the site easier for developers to access Amazon's internal product metrics.
2. In this lesson we also learned about how API's are becoming crucial to the expansion of the world wide web, and how JSON-based API's are already established on the interwebs currently. This helps nurture a community of users and devlopers creating better apps that respond to user actions.
3. In lesson 8 we also learned about through the usage of AJAX devlopers can write apps that automatically make HTTP requests to 3rd party servers. AJAX allows users to upload data from a server without refreshing their browser. This makes web pages better, faster, and a more interactive feel.
